# Tripla-Arcade

A Daily game, rotating between three different games each day:
    * Tic Tac Toe
        * Normal Tic Tac Toe
        * Ultimate Tic Tac Toe (in development)
    * Connect 4
    * TypeRacer

Each day, a particular game is displayed to be played. 
For the game that is chosen to be played, there are a couple of things that will happen:
    * The game board won't be the usual game board that is used to play the game. Instead, it will be designed to have a variety of "maps", i.e. a game board that is NOT a square and is made up a variety of shapes.
    * Each map will have "walls". Walls are cells that block a direct move to a cell in a vertical, horizontal, or diagonal manner. 
    * The winning condition for a game each day will change. However, there will be a setting to toggle between daily win conditions to the usual win conditions that is used to play the game worldwide. 
    * Each day, a "power-up" card will be distributed to a player that they can use once per day in a game. The power-up card will allow the player to either manipulate the map OR the placements of the game pieces to gain an advanage or disrupt the opponent's strategy.
    * Depending on the day, a special cell or two will be included on the map that provides either an advantage or a disadvantage to the player that puts a game piece on that cell. For fun effects, the special cell will be based on an event in history.
    * There will be a toggle setting for timers, i.e. players can have a limited amount of time to make a move or not. This setting can only be changed before a game and not mid-game.
    * Finally, a person can play this game multiple times. However, for the leaderboard, only the time spent getting to their first win counts.
